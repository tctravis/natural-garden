This is achieved through carefully matching plants to their environment and improving the soil with organic matter.  \nThriving plants not only look better for longer, they are also naturally resistant to pests, disease and the varied challenges of extreme and unpredictable weather.\nWe specialise in tending gardens with a natural feel - ranging from light-touch maintenance for 'wild' gardens to more designed planting schemes which mimic natural ecosystems - woodland, prairie, bog or gravel gardens."
